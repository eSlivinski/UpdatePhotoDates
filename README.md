# UpdatePhotoDates
Tiny script for updating EXIF data for a directory of photos

## To Run:
  1. Save your photos to `./photos`
  2. Update `ACTUAL_DATE` and `CAMERA_DATE` in `update_date.js` using a known time **on your camera** and **in real life**
  --> *I recommend taking a picture with your camera and a cell phone at the same time*
  3. `npm install`
  4. `node update_date.js`
  5. :tada: Celebrate! Your photos are all set to the correct date!
